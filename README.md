# README
Hey, if you're looking at this it is likely because you are from a roleplay server. Navigate with the above folders to look through my personal notes.
If you know what you are doing, you can download all of it and import into Obsidian as well for easier navigation. All the links are working, as that is the program I used to create the notes.

# Be mindful however. There are spoilers ahead.
This version is slightly out of date probably, as I only update it once every couple of weeks.

I hope you enjoy diving into my world, as much as I enjoy making it!
