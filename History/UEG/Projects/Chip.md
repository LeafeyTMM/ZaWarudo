Getting *"[[Chipped]]"* is step 2 of the Cataloguing ([[Catalogue]]) process. People get a small chip implanted into their brains, so that the UEG and their departments can track Espers ([[Esper]]).

There are 3 generations of chips thus far:
- Gen 1 chips: Are merely trackable individually. It is linked to a database, making it much easier to find and neutralize threats.
- Gen 2 chips: Can zap a person unconscious, or even kill them if given the instruction.
- Gen 3 chips can remotely disable Esper's Abilities ([[Ability]]) but have (allegedly) had the Gen 2 features removed.
