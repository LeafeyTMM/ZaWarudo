Pronounced: Euro-Dollars (Definitely not a Cyberpunk reference)
Common currency put in place shortly after the Establishment of the [[UEG]]. Part of the effort to unify the globe.

Price comparison to IRL products:
- Bag of Chips/Crisps would be 1€$
- A flat screen TV would be around 600€$ (40" TV)
So about the value of 1 Euro in our days.
