Every [[Esper]] is categorized into the above ranks ([[Rankers]]). A person's rank can change depending on their mastery of their respective [[Ability]]. That's not to say that everyone can reach the top ranks; Not all abilities are created equally. Some have better potential than others. As an example, control of fire (pyro-kinesis) obviously has more potential than simple resistance to fire.
