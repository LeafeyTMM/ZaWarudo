[[Calamity]] class [[Runaway]] [[Esper]].
First or "Control" Subject of [[Project May Flower]]. After her awakening was deemed unsuccessful she was thrown back into the [[Waste Bucket]] with other [[Child Error]]s, where she discovered that she could steal other people's abilities, she hid this fact from her "caretakers", stealing abilities from the other children, one after the other; until at 16, she made her move, escaping the facility effortlessly and avoiding the [[Esper Police Force]] for months, before making her first move.

She destroyed the dormitory of [[The Academy]] where [[Esper]]s were sleeping, killing over 50 students before they even noticed her presence. By the time the EPF arrived, she was long gone. The only thing they found at the scene of the catastrophe was a hand written note with an eerie smiley face on the back. The note read:

>"Do they know? Has anyone told them the horrors others had to go through for your little 'Prodigies' to gain their powers?
>We were lied to... Deceived...
>
>You told us we're going to be special... just like the naturals... 
>
> WELL LOOK AT ME NOW! AREN'T I A LITTLE SPECIAL SOMETHING?
>
>I will see this place burn... if it's the last thing I do... 
>																- Subject-000"

This note is classified, as it hints to the secrets of the [[UEG]]. Only [[S]] and above ranking individuals are told of it's existence, and only the higher ups know it's contents.

The Hunter's existence is known to all academy students. As she is Public Enemy #1.
A KOS (Kill-On-Sight) order is out for her. Anyone who brings her corpse to the [[Oldest House]] will be credited 100 000 000[[â‚¬$]]
